# Research

My main research area is quantum information theory. Here, my focus is on (quantum) Shannon theory, communication, learning and generally everything that is investigated using entropic quantities. <br />
Entropy is a fundamental concept when it comes to quantifying information, both classical and quantum. Understanding the differences of these two worlds and overcoming the difficulties provided by the more challenging mathematical framework of quantum physics is at the center of my research. <br />

### Tracking information in quantum networks

This is the title of my <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101025848">Marie Skłodowska-Curie  project</a>. Thanks to a Global Fellowship I will work at [TU Munich](https://www.tum.de) and [CQT](https://www.quantumlah.org) [NUS](https://www.nus.edu.sg) with [Robert König](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/koenig-robert-t) and [Marco Tomamichel](https://marcotom.info) to better understand how entropic quantites can be used to investigate quantum networks. <br />
